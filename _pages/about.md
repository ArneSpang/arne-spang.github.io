I am a geoscientist with a strong focus on computational thermomechanics. My work includes:
- Development of high-performance GPU code in Julia and CPU code in C
- Running geodynamic models
- Processing and analyzing results in Julia, Python, and Matlab
- Testing parameter sensitvity and deriving scaling laws from a large suite of models
- Inverting geophysical observations such as seismic imaging, gravity, and ground deformation to constrain subsurface processes and material parameters
- Magmatic systems
- Deep earthquakes

I am still building this page. There will be some content. One day, I promise...
