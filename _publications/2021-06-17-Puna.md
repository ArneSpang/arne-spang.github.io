* 3D visco-elasto-plastic thermomechanical modeling of the Altiplano-Puna magma system, constraining density, melt content and geometry of the Altiplano-Puna magma body (APMB)
* Joint, dynamically consistent, interpretation of seismic imaging, gravity anomalies, and surface velocities, including uncertainty estimation
* APMB has a central rise of about 80 km diameter, a density contrast of 90–130 kg/m3 to the crust and a melt content of 15%–22%
