* New, simple, intuitive and open-source method to describe and manipulate complex 3D bodies with a small number of parameters
* Allows for the integration of uncertainties of the initial geometry and enables inverting for geometric properties in numerical models
* Applications to a salt diapir with uncertain initial geometry and a subduction zone with uncertain initial subduction angle
