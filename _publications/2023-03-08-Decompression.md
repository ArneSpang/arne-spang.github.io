* We present a numerical quantification of the effect of thermal stresses in visco-elasto-plastic rock with tensile and dilatant shear failure
* The pressure drop in thermally contracting upper crustal magma bodies can exceed 100 MPa, potentially triggering devolatilization
* Thermal cracking can create an extensive fracture network around an upper crustal magma body
